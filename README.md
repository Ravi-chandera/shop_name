# shop_name_detection
We are detecting name of the shops from a video.
## 1. Image Collections 
I collected the Images that contains the shops. Open source data dosen't include anything like this so i need to collect them manually from various youtube videos.
## 2. Image Annotations 
The collecetd images are annotated by cvat.ai platform. At the end i got the image dataset that is suitable to fine-tune YOLO model.
### Sample image before annotation 

### Sample image after annotation
